This is the readme for the python prototype of the pathplanner written by Jordan Cousineau.

main.py runs the pathplanner and dumps the info into a .json. Currently, it does not pull weather data; however, this could be changed by going to the graph file and uncommenting a line in the function "generate_graph". 

The pathplanner, environment, and node(s) can be found in their respective .py files.
